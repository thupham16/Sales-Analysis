# Cohort Analysis & Customer Segmentation with RFM

**Cohort Analysis** is method to group customers based on shared characteristics within a specific timeframe. In cohort analysis, customers are divided into distinct groups or cohorts based on factors such as their acquisition date, behavior, or demographics. By studying these cohorts, businesses can gain insights into customer retention, engagement, and behavior patterns over time.
>In this analysis, customers will be segmented based on the date of their first product purchase, and this segmentation will be performed on a monthly basis to determine how many of them (%) coming back for the following month in 2013-2016.
>
**Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM)** analysis is a technique to gain insights into customer spending patterns and effectively segment them, enable business to determine their target audience and devise tailored marketing campaigns.
- Recency: how recently a customer purchased a product.
- Frequency: how often they purchase.
- Monetary value: how much money they spend.
>
This Analysis is performed based on analytic data models, which is a part of Data Warehouse project.
The project includes: clean raw data, build dim and fact tables, analyze customer and sales.

# Overview of Dataset: 
> This dataset is about a fictitious company Wide World Importers, provided by Microsoft. Wide World Importers (WWI) is a wholesale novelty goods importer and distributor operating from the San Francisco bay area.
The dataset contains information about customers, products, stock and sales of WWI between 2013-01-01 and 2016-05-31. (source : Wide World Importers [dataset](https://dataedo.com/samples/html2/WideWorldImporters/#/doc/d5/wideworldimporters))

> The dataset has been cleansed and processed to create analytic data models for the purpose of analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Cohort Analysis
- Create Cohort
   - Sales period: year and month for each single transaction for each customer
   - Cohort group: year and month of a customerâ€™s first purchase

SITUATION: we are creating a model to calculate number of active user in each month for each cohort 
PROBLEM: if there is no transaction in any order month of a specific cohort => it will be missing lines for those order month, it must be display this month with count = 0
SOLUTION: we will handle sparse data by making it densed. By Cross join vs dim_year_month we will create every order month for each cohort, then use Left join to handle missing transactions
